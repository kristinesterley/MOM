MOM - Memory Organization Module

A texting reminder service to keep you on track!

Concept

Do you forget appointments or tasks that need to be comleted by a certain date? Are the automated reminder applications that exist not working for you? Do you rely on texts for communication? MOM will send you a text to remind you to do the things you need to do. To use this application, a user must create an account with a phone number. Before the user is allowed to create reminders, the user must accept texts from the specified phone number. The application will then allow the user to log in and to request reminder texts, specifying the text reminder message, date, time and frequency. 

Users also can update and delete their reminders.

Application

We are currently in testing phone. The final application is not available to the public to due texting fees.

Future Work

We plan to add a snooze feature so that a text repeats after a user specified time period and continues to do so until the user responds that he or she has completed the task specified in the reminder text. We need to add either advertising or user pay account in order to pay Twilio for texting service.
